## Who am I?

Resul Umit

- post-doctoral researcher in political science at the University of Oslo

- teaching and studying representation, elections, and parliaments
    - [a recent publication](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1478929920967588):
    Parliamentary communication allowances do not increase electoral turnout or incumbentsâ€™ vote share

--

<br>

- teaching workshops, also on

  - [writing reproducible research papers](https://resulumit.com/blog/rmd-workshop/)
  - [version control and collaboration](https://resulumit.com/teaching/git_workshop.html)
  - [working with Twitter data](https://resulumit.com/teaching/twtr_workshop.html)
  - [creating academic websites](https://resulumit.com/teaching/rbd_workshop.html)
    
--

<br>

- more information available at [resulumit.com](https://resulumit.com/)

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Overview

- One day, on how to automate the process of extracting data from websites

  - 150+ slides, 15+ exercises
  - a [demonstration website](https://luzpar.netlify.app/) for practice

--

<br>

- Designed for researchers with basic knowledge of R programming language

  - does not cover programming with R
      - e.g., we will use existing functions and packages   
<br>
  - ability to work with R will be very helpful
      - but not absolutely necessary &mdash; this ability can be developed during and after the workshop as well
        
---
## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation

- Data available on websites provide attractive opportunities for academic research

  - e.g., parliamentary websites were the main source of data for my PhD

--

<br>

- Acquiring such data requires 

  - either a lot of resources, such as time
  - or a set of skills, such as automated web scraping

--

<br>

- Typically, such skills are not part of academic training

  - for my PhD, I hand-visited close to 3000 webpages to collect data manually
      - on members of ten parliaments
      - multiple times, to update the dataset as needed

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation &mdash; Aims

- To provide you with an understanding of what is ethically possible

  - we will cover a large breath of issues, not all of it is for long-term memory
      - hence the slides are designed for self study as well    
<br>
  - awareness of what is ethical and possible, `Google`, and perseverance are all you need

--

<br>

- To start you with acquiring and practicing the skills needed 

  - practice with the demonstration website
     - plenty of data, stable structure, and an ethical playground
  - start working on a real project

## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation

- Breakout in groups of two for exercises

  - participants learn as much from their partner as from instructors
  - switch partners after every other part
  - leave your breakout room manually, when everyone in the group is ready

<br> 

- Type, rather than copy and paste, the code that you will find on these slides

  - typing is a part of the learning process
  - slides are, and will remain, available at [resulumit.com/teaching/scrp_workshop.html](https://resulumit.com/teaching/scrp_workshop.html)

<br> 

- When you have a question

  - ask your partner
  - google together
  - ask me

## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation &mdash; Slides

Slides with this background colour indicate that your action is required, for

- setting the workshop up
    - e.g., installing R 
    
- completing the exercises
    - e.g., checking website protocols
    - these slides have countdown timers
        - as a guide, not to be followed strictly
    
`r countdown(minutes = 3, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation &mdash; Slides

- Code and text that go in R console or scripts .inline-c[appear as such &mdash; in a different font, on gray background]    

    - long codes and texts will have their own line(s)

```{r, demonstration, eval=FALSE}
bow(url = "https://luzpar.netlify.app/members/") %>%
  scrape() %>%
  html_elements(css = "td+ td a") %>% 
  html_attr("href") %>% 
  url_absolute(base = "https://luzpar.netlify.app/")
```

## Workshop Slides &mdash; Access on Your Browser

- Having the workshop slides<sup>*</sup> on your own machine might be helpful

  - flexibility to go back and forward on your own
      - especially while in a breakout room
  - ability to scroll across long codes on some slides

<br>

- Access at <https://resulumit.com/teaching/scrp_workshop.html>

  - will remain accessible after the workshop
  - might crash for some Safari users
      - if using a different browser application is not an option, view the [PDF version of the slides](https://github.com/resulumit/scrp_workshop/blob/master/presentation/scrp_workshop.pdf) on GitHub

## Demonstration Website &mdash; Explore on Your Browser

- There is a demonstration website for this workshop

   - available at <https://luzpar.netlify.app/>
   - includes fabricated data on the imaginary Parliament of Luzland
   - provides us with plenty of data, stable structure, and an ethical playground

<br>

- Using this demonstration website for practice is recommended

   - tailored to exercises, no ethical concern
   - but not compulsory &mdash; use a different one if you prefer so

<br>
 
- Explore the website now

   - click on the links to see an individual page for 
       - states, constituencies, members, and documents
   - notice that the documents section is different than the rest
       - it is a page with dynamic frame

# Part 2. Preliminary Considerations

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Law

- Web scraping might be illegal     
<br>
   - depending on who is scraping what, why, how &mdash; and under which jurisdiction
   - reflect, and check, before you scrape

--

<br>

- Web scraping might be more likely to be illegal if, for example,      
<br>
   - it is harmful to the source
      - commercially
          - e.g., scraping a commercial website to create a rival website     
      - physically
          - e.g., scraping a website so hard and fast that it collapses    
<br>
   - it gathers data that is
      - under copyright
      - not meant for the public to see
      - then used for financial gain

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics

- Web scraping might be unethical
   - depending on who is scraping what, why, and how
   - reflect before you scrape

--

<br>

- Web scraping might be more likely to be unethical if, for example,    
<br>
   - it is &mdash; edging towards &mdash; being illegal
   - it does not respect the restrictions
      - as defined in `robots.txt` files    
<br>
   - it harvests data 
       - that is otherwise available to download, e.g., through APIs
       - without purpose, at dangerous speed, repeatedly

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; `robots.txt`

- Most websites declare a robots exclusion protocol

   - making their rules known with respect to programmatic access
       - who is (not) allowed to scrape what, and sometimes, at what speed     
<br>       
   - within `robots.txt` files
       - available at, e.g., www.websiteurl.com<span style="background-color: #ffff88;">/robots.txt</span>

<br>

- The rules in `robots.txt` cannot not enforced upon scrapers
  - but should be respected for ethical reasons
  
<br>

- The language in `robots.txt` files is specific but intuitive
  - easy to read and understand
  - the `robotstxt` package makes these even easier

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; `robots.txt` &mdash; Syntax

.pull-left[

- It has pre-defined keys, most importantly

   - `User-agent` indicates who the protocol is for
   
   - `Allow` indicates which part(s) of the website can be scraped
   
   - `Disallow` indicates which part(s) must not be scraped
   
   - `Crawl-delay` indicates how fast the website could be scraped

<br>

- In case you write your own protocol one day, note that

   - the keys start with capital letters
   - they are followed by a colon .yellow-h[:]

]

.pull-right[

```md
`User-agent:`
`Allow:`
`Disallow:`
`Crawl-delay:`

```

]

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; `robots.txt` &mdash; Syntax

.pull-left[

- Websites define their own values

   - after a colon and a white space

<br>

- Note that

   - &#42; indicates the protocol is for everyone
   - `/` indicates all sections and pages
   - `/about/` indicates a specific path
   - values for `Crawl-delay` are in seconds    
<br>   
   - this website allows anyone to scrape, provided that
       - `/about/` is left out, and 
       - the website is accessed at 5-seconds intervals

]

.pull-right[

```md
User-agent: `*`
Allow: `/`
Disallow: `/about/`
Crawl-delay: `5`

```

]

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; `robots.txt` &mdash; Syntax

Files might include optional comments, written after the number sign .yellow-h[&#x23;]


```md
`# thank you for respecting our protocol`

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /about/
Crawl-delay: 5    `# five second delay, to ensure our servers are not overloaded`

```

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; `robots.txt` &mdash; Syntax

The protocol of this website only applies to Google

- Google is allowed to scrape everything
- there is no defined rule for anyone else

<br>

```md
User-agent: `googlebot`
Allow: /

```

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; `robots.txt` &mdash; Syntax


The protocol of this website only applies to Google

- Google is .yellow-h[disallowed] to scrape .yellow-h[two] specific paths
    - with no limit on speed
- there is no defined rule for anyone else

<br>

```md
User-agent: googlebot
`Disallow: /about/`
`Disallow: /history/`

```

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; `robots.txt` &mdash; Syntax


This website has different protocols for different agents

- Google is allowed to scrape everything, with a 5-second delay
- Bing is not allowed to scrape anything
- everyone else can scrape the section or page located at www.websiteurl/about/

<br>

```md
User-agent: googlebot
Allow: /
Crawl-delay: 5

User-agent: bing
Disallow: /

User-agent: *
Allow: /about/

```

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; `robotstxt`

- The `robotstxt` packages facilitates checking website protocols

   - from within R &mdash; no need to visit websites via browser
   - provides functions to check, among others, the rules for specific paths and/or agents

<br>

- There are two main functions

   - `robotstxt`, which gets complete protocols
   - `paths_allowed`, which checks protocols for one or more specific paths


---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; `robotstxt`

.pull-left[

Use the `robotstxt` function to get a protocol
- supply a base URL with the `domain` argument
   - as a string
   - probably the only argument that you will need

]


.pull-right[

```md

robotstxt(
  domain = NULL,
  ...
)

```

]

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; `robotstxt`

```{r}
robotstxt(domain = "https://luzpar.netlify.app")
```

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; `robotstxt`

.pull-left[

Use the `paths_allowed` function to checks protocols for one or more specific paths
- supply a base URL with the `domain` argument
- `path` and `bot` are the other important arguments
   - notice the default values    
<br>
- leads to either `TRUE` (allowed to scrape) or `FALSE` (not allowed)

]


.pull-right[

## Exercises

1) Check the protocols for <https://www.theguardian.com>

   - via a browser and with the `robotstxt` function
   - compare what you see
   
<br>

2) Check a path with the `paths_allowed` function

   - such that it will return `FALSE`
   - taking the information from Exercise 1 into account
   
<br>

3) Check the protocols for any website that you might wish to scrape

  - with the `robotstxt` function

`r countdown(minutes = 7, seconds = 30, top = 0)`

---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; Speed

- Websites are designed for visitors with human-speed in mind

   - computer-speed visits can overload servers, depending on bandwidth
      - popular websites might have more bandwidth
      - but, they might attract multiple scrapers at the same time

<br>

- Waiting a little between two visits makes scraping more ethical
    
  - waiting time may or may not be defined in the protocol
      - lookout for, and respect, the `Crawl-delay` key in `robots.txt`     
<br>
  - [Part 5](#part5) and [Part 6](#part6) covers how to wait
  
<br>

- Not waiting enough might lead to a ban
    - by site owners, administrators
    - for IP addresses with undesirably high number of visits in a short period of time
      
---
## Considerations &mdash; the Ethics &mdash; Purpose

Ideally, we scrape for a purpose
  
- e.g., for academics, to answer one or more research questions, test hypotheses    
<br>
      - developed prior to data collection, analysis
          - based on, e.g., theory, claims, observations   
<br>
      - perhaps, even pre-registered
          - e.g., at [OSF Registries](https://osf.io/registries)

---
## Considerations &mdash; Data Storage

Scraped data frequently requires 

- large amounts of digital storage space
  - internet data is typically big data    
<br>
- private, safe storage spaces
  - due to local rules, institutional requirements

# Part 3. HTML Basics

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]

---
## HTML &mdash; Overview

- Webpages include more than what is immediately visible to visitors

  - not only text, images, links
  - but also code for structure, style, and functionality &mdash; interpreted by browsers first
      - HTML provides the structure
      - CSS provides the style
      - JavaScript provides functionality, if any
      
<br>

- Web scraping requires working with the source code

   - even when scraping only what is already visible
   - to choose one or more desired parts of the visible
      - e.g., text in table and/or bold only    
<br>

- Source code also offers more, invisible, data to be scraped
      - e.g., URLs hidden under text
           
---
## HTML &mdash; Webpage Source

The `Ctrl` `+` `U` shortcut is to display source code &mdash; alternatively, right click and `View` `Page` `Source`


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.show="hold", out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("scrp_workshop_files/images_data/homepage.png")
knitr::include_graphics("scrp_workshop_files/images_data/homepage_source.png")
```


---
## HTML &mdash; DOM

Browsers also offer putting source codes in a structure
- known as DOM (document object model), initiated by the `F12` key on Chrome

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.show="hold", out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("scrp_workshop_files/images_data/homepage.png")
knitr::include_graphics("scrp_workshop_files/images_data/homepage_dom.png")
```

---
class: action

## Exercises

4) View the source code of a page
- as plain code and as in DOM
- compare the look of the two

<br>

5) Search for a word or a phrase in source code
- copy from the front-end page
- search in plain text code or in DOM
   - using the `Ctrl` `+` `F` shortcut    
<br>   
- compare the look of the front- and back-end

`r countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

.pull-left[

- HTML stands for .yellow-h[hypertext markup language]

   - would a piece of text appear in a paragraph or a list?
       - depends on the HTML code around that text

       <li>list</li>
    </ul>
  `</body>`
</html>

```
]

---
## HTML &mdash; Syntax

Most elements have opening and closing .yellow-h[tags]

```md
`<p>`This is a one sentence paragraph.`</p>`

```

.out-t[

This is a one sentence paragraph.

]


<br>

Note that

- tag name, in this case .yellow-h[p], defines the structure of the element
- the closing tag has a forward slash .yellow-h[/] before the element name

---
## HTML &mdash; Syntax

Most elements have some content

```md
<p>`This is a one sentence paragraph.`</p>

```

.out-t[

This is a one sentence paragraph.

]

---
## HTML &mdash; Syntax

Elements can be nested

```md
<p>This is a <strong>one</strong> sentence paragraph.</p>

```

.out-t[

<p>This is a <strong>one</strong> sentence paragraph.</p>
]


<br>

Note that

- there are two elements above, a paragraph and a strong emphasis
- strong is said to be the child of the paragraph element
   - there could be more than one child
   - in that case, children are numbered from the left      
<br>   
- paragraph is said to be the parent of the strong element

---
## HTML &mdash; Syntax

Elements can have .yellow-h[attributes]

```md
<p>This is a <strong `id="sentence-count"`>one</strong> sentence paragraph.</p>

```

.out-t[
<p>This is a <strong id="sentence-count">one</strong> sentence paragraph.</p>
]


<br>

Note that

- the id attribute is not visible to the visitors
- attribute string .yellow-h[sentence-count] could have been anything I could come up with
    - unlike the tag and attribute names &mdash; e.g., strong, id as they are pre-defined      
<br>    
- there are some other attributes that are visible


---
## HTML &mdash; Syntax

There could be more than one attribute in an element

```md
<p>This is a <strong `class="count"` `id="sentence-count"`>one</strong> sentence paragraph.</p>

<p>There are now <strong `class="count"` `id="paragraph-count"`>two</strong> paragraphs.</p>

```

.out-t[
<p>This is a <strong class="count" id="sentence-count">one</strong> sentence paragraph.</p>

<p>There are now <strong class="count" id="paragraph-count">two</strong> paragraphs.</p>

]


<br>

Note that

- there could be more than one attribute in an element
    - with a white space in between them    
<br>
- the `class` attribute can apply to multiple elements
   - while the `id` attribute must be unique on a page

---
## HTML &mdash; Important Elements & Attibutes 

Links are provided with the a (anchor) element

```md
<p>Click <a href="https://www.google.com/">here</a> to google things.</p>

```

.out-t[
<p>Click <a href="https://www.google.com/">here</a> to google things.</p>
]

<br>

Note that

- `href` (hypertext reference) is a required attribute for this element
- most attributes are optional, some are required

---
## HTML &mdash; Links 

Links

```md
<p>Click <a `title="This text appears when visitors hover over the link"` 
            href="https://www.google.com/">here</a> to google things.</p>

```

.out-t[
<p>Click <a title="This text appears when visitors hover over the link" 
            href="https://www.google.com/">here</a> to google things.</p>
]

<br>

Note that

- the `title` attribute is one of the optional attributes
- it becomes visible when hovered over with mouse

---
## HTML &mdash; Lists

The `<ul>` tag introduces un-ordered lists, while the `<li>` tag defines lists items

```{r eval=FALSE}
<ul>
  <li>books</li>
  <li>journal articles</li>
  <li>reports</li>
</ul>
```

.out-t[

<ul>
  <li>books</li>
  <li>journal articles</li>
  <li>reports</li>
</ul>


]

<br>

Note that

- Ordered lists are introduced with the the `<ol>` tag instead

---
## HTML &mdash; HTML &mdash; Notes

By default, multiple spaces and/or lines breaks are ignored by browsers

```{r eval=FALSE}
<ul><li>books</li><li>journal                     articles</li><li>reports
</li>
  
  
</ul>
```

.out-t[

<ul><li>books</li><li>journal                     articles</li><li>reports
</li>
  
  
</ul>

]

<br>

Note that

- plain source code may or may not be written in a readable manner
- this is one reason why DOM is helpful

## Exercises

6) Re-create the .yellow-h[body] of the page at <https://luzpar.netlify.app/states/> in R

- start an HTML file, following from the RStudio menu:

> `File -> New File -> HTML File`

- copy the text from the website, paste in the HTML file
- add the structure with HTML code
- click `Preview` to view the result

<br>

7) Add an attribute to an element
- which is not already on the original page
- hints:
   - there are at least two attributes for the list elements on the original page
   - google to see what attributes list items accept
   - <https://www.w3schools.com/> is a great place to look at
   - save this document as we will continue working on it

# Part 5. Scraping Static Pages

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]

---
## Static Pages &mdash; Overview

- We will collect data from static pages with the `rvest` package

   - static pages are those that display the same source code to all visitors
       - including the content &mdash; it does not change    
<br>       
   - every visitor sees the same page at a given URL
   - each page has a different URL
   - <https://luzpar.netlify.app/> is a static page

<br>

- Scraping static pages involves two main tasks

   - download the source code from one or more pages to R
      - typically, the only interaction with the page itself     
<br>
   - select the exact information needed from the source code
      - takes place locally, on your machine
      - the main functionality that `rvest` offers
          - with the help from selectors
    
---
## Static Pages &mdash; `rvest` &mdash; Overview

- A relative small R package for web scraping

  - created by [Hadley Wickham](http://http://hadley.nz/)
  - popular &mdash; used by many for web scraping
      - downloaded `r format(sum(cran_downloads(when = "last-month", packages = "rvest")$count), big.mark=",")` times last month

  - you will find solutions to, or help for, any issues online
  - see first the [package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf), numerous tutorials &mdash; such as [this](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) and [this](https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/), and [this](https://steviep42.github.io/webscraping/book/index.html#quick-rvest-tutorial)

- Comes with the recommendation to combine it with the `polite` package

   - for ethical web scraping

## Static Pages &mdash; `rvest` &mdash; Get Source Code

Use the `read_html` function to get the source code of a webpage into R

```{r}
read_html("https://luzpar.netlify.app/")
```

---
## Static Pages &mdash; `rvest` &mdash; Get Source Code

You may wish to check the protocol first

```{r, message=FALSE}
paths_allowed(domain = "https://luzpar.netlify.app/")
read_html("https://luzpar.netlify.app/")
```

## Static Pages &mdash; `rvest` &mdash; Get Source Code &mdash; `polite`

- The `polite` package facilitates ethical scraping

   - recommended by `rvest`

<br>

- It divides the process of getting source code into two
   
   - check the protocol
   - get the source only if allowed

<br>

- It also 

   - waits for a period of time
       - minimum by what is specified in the protocol     
<br>
   - allows you to introduce yourself to website administrators while scraping

Keep the number of interactions with websites to minimum
- by saving the source code as an object, which could be used repeatedly

            `scrape()`

## Exercise

9) Create a dataframe out of the table at <https://luzpar.netlify.app/members/>
- with as many variables as possible
- hints:
   - start with the code in the previous slide, and add new variables from attributes
   - the first two columns have important attributes
      - e.g., URLs for the pages for members and their constituencies
      - make these URLs absolute   
      - see what other attributes are there to collect     

`r countdown(minutes = 15, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

## Static Pages &mdash; Crawling &mdash; Overview

- Rarely a single page includes all variables that we need

  - instead, they are often scattered across different pages of a website
  - e.g., we might need data on election results &mdash; in addition to constituency names

<br>

- Web scraping then requires crawling across pages
  
   - using information found on one page, to go to the next
   - website design may or may not facilitate crawling

<br>

- We can write for loops to crawl

  - the speed of our code matters the most when we crawl
  - ethical concerns are higher

---
## Static Pages &mdash; Crawling &mdash; Example

**Task:**    

- I need data on the name and vote share of parties that came second in each constituency
- This data is available on constituency pages, but
   - there are too many such pages
      - e.g., <https://luzpar.netlify.app/constituencies/arford/>
   - I do not have the URL to these pages

--

<br>

**Plan:**

- Scrape <https://luzpar.netlify.app/members/> for URLs
- Write a for loop to
    - visit these pages one by one
    - collect and save the variables needed
    - write these variables into a list
    - turn the list into a dataframe

---
## Static Pages &mdash; Crawling &mdash; Example

Scrape the page that has all URLs, for absolute URLs

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
the_links <- bow(url = "https://luzpar.netlify.app/members/") %>%
        scrape() %>%
        html_elements(css = "td+ td a") %>% 
        html_attr("href") %>% 
        url_absolute(base = "https://luzpar.netlify.app/")

# check if it worked
head(the_links)

```

---
## Static Pages &mdash; Crawling &mdash; Example

Create an empty list

```{r, eval=FALSE}

## Exercise

10) Crawl into members' personal pages to create a rich dataset
- with members being the unit of observation


<br>

Hints:
- see an example dataset at <https://luzpar.netlify.app/files/exercises/static_data.csv>
- start with the related code in the previous slides, and adopt it to your needs
-  practice with 3 members until you are ready to run the loop for all 
    - e.g., by replacing `1:length(the_links)` with `1:3` for the loop

`r countdown(minutes = 45, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

# Part 6. Scraping Dynamic Pages

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Overview

- Dynamic pages are ones that display custom content 

   - different visitors might see different content on the same page
        - while the URL remains the same    
<br>
   - depending on, for example, their own input
       - e.g., clicks, scrolls     
<br>
   - <https://luzpar.netlify.app/documents/> is a page with a dynamic part

--

<br>

- Dynamic pages are more difficult than static pages to scrape
   
   - it involves three, instead of two, steps
   - we will have a new package, `RSelenium`, for the additional step


---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Three Steps to Scrape

Scraping dynamic pages involves three main tasks      
<br>
- Create the desired instance of the dynamic page
  - with the `RSelenium` package
  - e.g., by clicking, scrolling, filling in forms
      - from within R    
<br>
- Get the source code into R
      - `RSelenium` downloads XML
      - `rvest` turns it into HTML    
<br>
- Select the exact information needed from the source code
      - as for static pages
      - with the the`rvest` page
    
---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; `Rselenium` &mdash; Overview

- A package that integrates [Selenium 2.0 WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/) into R

  - created by [John Harrison](http://johndharrison.github.io/#/cover)
  - downloaded `r format(sum(cran_downloads(when = "last-month", packages = "RSelenium")$count), big.mark=",")` times last month
  - last updated in February 2020

--

<br>

- A lot has already been written on this package

  - you will find solutions to, or help for, any issues online
  - see the [package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium/RSelenium.pdf) and the [vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium/vignettes/basics.html) for basic functionality
  - Google searches return code and tutorials in various languages
      - not only R but also Python, Java

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; `Rselenium` &mdash; Overview

- The package involves more methods than functions
  
  - code look slightly unusual
  - as it follows the logic behind Selenium

--

<br>

- It allows interacting with two things &mdash; and it is crucial that we are aware of the difference

  - browsers
      - e.g., opening a browser and navigating to a page     
<br>
  - elements
      - e.g., opening and clicking on a drop-down menu

## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Starting a Server

.pull-left[

- Use the `rsDriver` function to start a server

  - so that you can control a web browser from within R

.pull-right[

```md
rsDriver(port = 4567L, 
         browser = "chrome", 
         version = "latest", 
         chromever = "latest",
         ...
         )

```

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Starting a Server

.pull-left[

- Use the `rsDriver` function to start a server
    - so that you can control a web browser from within R

<br>

- Note that the defaults can cause errors, such as
   - tying to start two servers from the same .yellow-[port]



]


.pull-right[

```md
rsDriver(`port` = 4567L, 
         browser = "chrome",

## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Starting a Server

.pull-left[

- Use the `rsDriver` function to start a server
    - so that you can control a web browser from within R

<br>

- Note that the defaults can cause errors, such as
   - tying to start two servers from the same port
   - any mismatch between the .yellow[version and driver numbers]

]


.pull-right[

```md
rsDriver(port = 4567L, 
         browser = "chrome", 
         `version = "latest"`, 
         `chromever = "latest"`,
         ...
         )

```

]

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Starting a Server

- The latest version of the driver is too new for my browser
  - I have to use an older version to make it work
  - after checking the available versions with the following code

```{r}
binman::list_versions("chromedriver")
```

--

<br>

- Note that

  - you can only use the version that *you* get
  - not one of the version that you see on this slide

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Starting a Server

.pull-left[

- Then the function works

  - a web browser opens as a result
  - an R object named .yellow-h[driver] is created

<br>

- Note that

   - the browser says .yellow-h["Chrome is being controlled by automated test software."]
    
    - you should avoid controlling this browser manually
    
    - you should also avoid creating multiple servers
   

]

.pull-right[

```md
driver <- rsDriver(`chromever = "90.0.4430.24"`)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("scrp_workshop_files/images_data/chrome_works.png")
```

]

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Starting a Server

Separate the .yellow-h[client] and .yellow-h[server] as different objects

```{r, eval=FALSE}
browser <- driver$client
server <- driver$server
```

<br>

Note that

- `rsDriver()` creates a client and a server
   - the code above singles out the client, with which our code will interact
   - client is best thought as the browser itself
       - it has the class of `remoteDriver`

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Navigate

Navigate to a page with the following notation

```md
browser`$navigate`(url = "https://luzpar.netlify.app")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("scrp_workshop_files/images_data/navigate.png")
```

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Navigate

Navigate to a page with the following notation

```md
browser`$`navigate("https://luzpar.netlify.app")
```

<br>

Note that

- `navigate` is called .yellow-h[a method, not a function]
    - it cannot be piped into `browser`
    - use the dollar sign <span style="background-color: #ffff88;">$</span> notation instead
    - it is not necessary to type the name of the `url` argument 

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Navigate

Check the description of any method as follows
- with no parentheses after the method name

```md
browser$navigate
```

.out-t[

```
Class method definition for method navigate()
function (url) 
{
    "Navigate to a given url."
    qpath <- sprintf("%s/session/%s/url", serverURL, sessionInfo[["id"]])
    queryRD(qpath, "POST", qdata = list(url = url))
}
<environment: 0x00000173db9035a8>

Methods used: 
     "queryRD"
```

]

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Navigate

Go back to the previous URL

```md
browser$goBack()
```
<br>

Go forward

```md
browser$goForward()
```
<br>

Refresh the page

```md
browser$refresh()
```

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Navigate

Get the URL of the current page

```md
browser$CurrentUrl()
```
<br>

Get the title of the current page

```md
browser$getTitle()
```

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Close and Open

Close the browser
- which will not close the session on the server
    - recall that we singled the client out

```md
browser$close()
```

<br>

Open a new browser
- which does not require the `rsDriver` function
   - because the server is still running

```md
browser$open()
```

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Get Page Source

Get the page source

```md
browser$getPageSource()[[1]]
```

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Get Page Source

Get the page source

```md
browser$getPageSource()`[[1]]`
```

<br>

Note that

- this method returns a list
   - XML source is in the first item
   - this is why we need the .inline-c[[[1]]] bit         
<br>
- this is akin to `read_html()` for static pages
    - or `bow()` `%>%` `scrape()`    
<br>    
- `rvest` usually takes over after this step

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Get Page Source

Get the page source
- by combining the two package

```md
browser$getPageSource()[[1]] %>% 
        read_html() %>% 
        html_elements("#title a") %>% 
        html_attr("href")
```

.out-t[

```

[9] "https://github.com/wowchemy"   

```

]

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Get Page Source

Get the page source
- by using both packages

```md
browser$getPageSource()[[1]] %>% 
        read_html() %>% 
        html_elements("#title a") %>% 
        html_attr("href")
```

<br>

Note that

- this method gets the source for only what is physically visible on the browser
- window size and position might become important
    - you may wish to maximise the window

```md
browser$browser$maxWindowSize()
```

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Browsers &mdash; Get Page Source

Get the page source
- by using both packages

```md
browser$getPageSource()[[1]] %>% 
        `read_html() %>%` 
        html_elements("#title a") %>% 
        html_attr("href")
```

<br>

Note that

- we still need the `read_html()` function
   - to turn XML into HTML

class: action

## Exercises

11) Navigate to and get the source code of a page
- e.g., <https://luzpar.netlify.app/constituencies/>
- by using both packages


<br>

13) See what other methods are available to interact with browsers
- by typing the object name for your client into R console
   - followed by the dollar sign
   - and hitting the tab key on your keyboard if necessary
- read the description for one or more of them

<br>

14) Try one or more new methods
- e.g., take a screenshot of your browser
   - and view it in R

`r countdown(minutes = 15, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Elements &mdash; Find

.pull-left[

- Locate an element on the open browser
    - to be interacted later on
        - e.g., clicking on the element
        
<br>

- Note that
   - the default selector is `xpath`
   - requires entering the `xpath` value

]


.pull-right[

```md

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Elements &mdash; Find

.pull-left[

- Locate an element on the open browser
    - using CSS selectors
        
<br>

- Note that

   - typing .yellow-h["css"], instead of .yellow-h["css selector"], also works

   - there are other selector schemes as well, including
      - id
      - name
      - link text
      
]


.pull-right[

```md

findElement(using = `"css selector"`, 
            value
            )

```

]
---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Elements &mdash; Find &mdash; Selectors

If there were a button on a page with the following DOM...

```md
<button class="big-button" id="only-button" name="clickable">Click Me</button>

```

<br>

Any of the following would find it

```md
browser$findElement(using = "xpath", value = '//*[(@id = "only-button")]')

browser$findElement(using = "css selector", value = ".big-button")

browser$findElement(using = "css", value = "#only-button")

browser$findElement(using = "id", value = "only-button")

browser$findElement(using = "name", value = "clickable")
```

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Elements &mdash; Objects

Save elements as R objects to be interacted later on

```
button <- browser$findElement(using = ..., value = ...)
```

<br>

Note the difference between the classes of clients and elements

.pull-left[

```md
class(browser)
```

.out-t[

```
[1] "remoteDriver"
attr(,"package")
[1] "RSelenium"
```
]

]


.pull-right[

```md
class(button)
```

.out-t[

```
[1] "webElement"
attr(,"package")
[1] "RSelenium"
```
]

]

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Elements &mdash; Highlight

Highlight the element found in the previous step, with the `highlightElement` method

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# navigate to a page
browser$navigate("http://luzpar.netlify.app/")

# find the element
menu_states <- browser$findElement(using = "link text", value = "States")

# highlight it to see if we found the correct element
menu_states$`highlightElement()`

```

<br>

Note that

- the highlighted element fill flash for a second or two on the browser
    - helpful to check if selection worked as intended  
    
---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Elements &mdash; Highlight

Highlight the element found in the previous step, with the `highlightElement` method

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# navigate to a page
browser$navigate("http://luzpar.netlify.app/")

# find the element
menu_states <- `browser$`findElement(using = "link text", value = "States")

# highlight it to see if we found the correct element
`menu_states$`highlightElement()

```

<br>

Note that

- the highlighted element fill flash for a second or two on the browser
    - helpful to check if selection worked as intended     
<br>    
- the highlight method is applied to the element (`menu_states`), not to the client (`browser`)
   - compare it to the find method

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Elements &mdash; Click

Click on the element found in the previous step, with the `clickElement` method

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# navigate to a page
browser$navigate("http://luzpar.netlify.app/")

# find an element
search_icon <- browser$findElement(using = "css", value = ".fa-search")

search_bar$clickElement()

# search for the keyword "Law" and click enter
search_bar$`sendKeysToElement(list(value = "Law", key = "enter"))`
```

---
## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Elements &mdash; Input &mdash; Example

Slow down the code where necessary, with the `Sys.sleep`
- for ethical reasons
- because R might be faster than the browser

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# navigate to the home page
browser$navigate("http://luzpar.netlify.app/")

# find the search icon and click on it
search_icon <- browser$findElement(using = "css", value = ".fa-search")

  - the `Id` argument takes an element object, unquoted
     - setting it to `NULL` returns to the default frame

## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Elements &mdash; Switch Frames

Switch to a non-default frame

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# navigate to a page and wait for the frame to load
browser$navigate("https://luzpar.netlify.app/documents/")
Sys.sleep(4)

# find the frame, which is an element
app_frame <- browser$findElement("css", "iframe")

# switch to it
browser$`switchToFrame(Id = app_frame)`

#switch back to the default frame
browser$`switchToFrame(Id = NULL)`

```

## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Scraping &mdash; Example

**Task:**    

- I need to download specific documents published by the parliament
   - e.g., proposals and reports
- The related section of the website is a dynamic page
    - initially it is empty, and clicking on things do not change the URL

--

<br>

**Plan:**

- Interact with the page until it displays the desired list of documents
- Get the page source and separate the links
- Write a for loop to
    - visit the related pages one by one
    - download the documents

## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Scraping &mdash; Example

Interact with the page until it displays the desired list of documents

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# navigate to the desired page and wait a little
browser$navigate("https://luzpar.netlify.app/documents/")
Sys.sleep(4)

# switch to the frame with the app
app_frame <- browser$findElement("css", "iframe")
browser$switchToFrame(Id = app_frame)

# find and open the drop down menu
drop_down <- browser$findElement(using = "css", value = ".bs-placeholder")
drop_down$clickElement()

# choose proposals
proposal <- browser$findElement(using = 'css', "[id='bs-select-1-1']")
proposal$clickElement()

# choose reports
report <- browser$findElement(using = 'css', "[id='bs-select-1-2']")
report$clickElement()

# close the drop down menu
drop_down$clickElement()

```

## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Scraping &mdash; Example

Get the page source and separate the links

```{r, eval=FALSE}
the_links <- browser$getPageSource()[[1]] %>% 
        read_html() %>% 
        html_elements("td a") %>% 
        html_attr("href")

print(the_links)
```

## Dynamic Pages &mdash; Scraping &mdash; Example

Write a for loop to download PDFs

```
for (i in 1:length(the_links)) {
        
pdf_link <- bow(url = the_links[i]) %>%
        scrape() %>%
        html_elements(css = ".btn-page-header") %>% 
        html_attr("href") %>% 
        url_absolute(base = "https://luzpar.netlify.app/")

download.file(url = pdf_link, destfile = basename(pdf_link))
        
}

```
