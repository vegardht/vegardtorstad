2. You can also put HTML in a markdown file and use the .md extension.  The Blackfriday markdown standard used in HUGO allows HTML to be placed in the markdown.  It just ignores the HTML when converting the markdown, assuming that it's already ready for primetime.  In fact, you can just put HTML in a markdown file and you'll be good.

**But, also consider this...**
More static site generators are using (encouraging) markdown as the means of content entry.  This scared me at first, but after thinking about it, I concluded that using markdown actually may strengthen the quality of the content. Markdown is easy to learn and can be actually easier to read than HTML (though mileage may vary).  My point is, using markdown encourages you to concentrate more on your content, which can make a stunning difference on your site.

If you do have markup and need more complex items like a YouTube vid, twitter card, etc..., you can use shortcodes. They're almost exactly like the ones used in Wordpress and Hugo comes packaged natively with a handful of them.  Check the docs, though. They are extremely simple to write and can allow you to functionally componentize your presentation tier, keeping it dry and less complicated.

Hit me if you have questions, but HTML isn't a problem at all.

	<p><strong>Can Transparency Strengthen the Legitimacy of International Institutions? Evidence from the UN Security Council)</strong><br />

Can transparency enhance the legitimacy of international institutions? As transparency has become a widely applied procedural standard in international politics, a range of institutions have implemented transparency reforms under the presumption that increased transparency can elicit support among relevant audiences. This paper
evaluates whether increased transparency in the UN Security Council leads to enhanced legitimacy perceptions among UN member states. The paper first traces the history of Security Council reform since 1990 and draws on interviews with diplomats and observers to describe a transparency reform the Council enacted in 2006. Next, the paper uses longitudinal content analysis to empirically probe the legitimation effects of that transparency reform. The empirical analysis is based on an original dataset of 4303 legitimacy statements made by UN member states in annual UN General Assembly debates over the periods 1990-2006 and 2006-2018. The findings cast doubt over the potential of transparency reform to improve the Councilâ€™s legitimacy; and instead suggest that increasing the direct participation of the wider UN membership may be a more viable legitimation strategy. This article contributes to existing international legitimacy literature by providing empirical evidence on the relationship between transparency and legitimacy; and by demonstrating which institutional features that affect the perceived legitimacy of the Security Council.

	Under the Paris Agreement, parties self-determine their mitigation ambition level by submitting Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Extant assessments find that the collective ambition of current pledges is not line with the Agreement's goals and that individual ambition varies greatly across countries, but there have not been attempts at explaining this variation. This paper identifies several potential drivers of national climate ambition, and tests whether these can account for differences in the ambition level of countries' mitigation targets under the Paris Agreement. After outlining theorized relationships between a set of domestic political characteristics and climate policy ambition, regression analysis is used to assess the effects of different potential drivers across a dataset of 170 countries. We find that a country's level of democracy and vulnerability to climate change have positive effects on NDC ambition, while coal rent and GDP have negative effects. Our findings suggest that these objective factors are more important than subjective factors, while the most influential subjective factor is the cosmopolitanism-nativism value dimension.
