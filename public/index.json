While the Paris Agreement has been acclaimed for spurring universal participation, its mitigation mechanism – an unenforced bottom-up framework of voluntary pledges – has been criticized for lacking ambition and incentivizing free riding. Does the Paris Agreement come with effectiveness trade-offs? How ambitious is the Agreement, and how likely is it that countries will comply with it? Using an effectiveness formula to assess ambition, I find that the Paris Agreement constitutes an important improvement compared to business-as-usual. Further, based on evidence from interviews with 21 climate negotiators and observers, the compliance prospects of the Agreement are evaluated as moderately positive. I conclude that the Agreement has the potential to overcome the effectiveness trilemma, and outline policy measures for achieving that objective.”\n ","date":1581379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581379200,"objectID":"6a3ccaea138e009657fc3a95e3dde71d","permalink":"https://vegardtorstad.netlify.app/publication/journal-article/eppaper/","publishdate":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/eppaper/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract “An effective climate agreement should simultaneously foster broad participation, high ambition, and sufficient compliance: this is the ‘effectiveness trilemma’.

Extant assessments find that the collective ambition of current pledges is not line with the Agreement’s goals and that individual ambition varies greatly across countries, but there have not been attempts at explaining this variation. This paper identifies several potential drivers of national climate ambition, and tests whether these can account for differences in the ambition level of countries\u0026#39; mitigation targets under the Paris Agreement. After outlining theorized relationships between a set of domestic political characteristics and climate policy ambition, regression analysis is used to assess the effects of different potential drivers across a dataset of 170 countries. We find that a country’s level of democracy and vulnerability to climate change have positive effects on NDC ambition, while coal rent and GDP have negative effects. Our findings suggest that these objective factors are more important than subjective factors, while the most influential subjective factor is the cosmopolitanism-nativism value dimension.”\n ","date":1581379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581379200,"objectID":"52d4c2c605a3a09ab73932a8341d344c","permalink":"https://vegardtorstad.netlify.app/publication/journal-article/erlpaper/","publishdate":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/erlpaper/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract “Under the Paris Agreement, parties self-determine their mitigation ambition level by submitting Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
