abstract: The CLIMREC Dataset on Green Economic Recovery Spending offers new insights into the emissions profiles of 40 major economies’ economic recovery packages during the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses reveal that most governments have allocated modest recovery spending towards decarbonization objectives, with green spending patterns changing little over time. Overall, governments have prioritized emissions-neutral economic stabilization measures over advancing the clean energy transition in crisis-related fiscal spending.
