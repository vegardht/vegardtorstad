## States as Racketeers


"To the extent that the threats against which a  given government protects its citizens are imaginary or are consequences of its own activities, the government has organized a  protection racket."

Charles Tilly, "War Making and State Making as Organized Crime"  

---

- **Protection racket**--a scheme that involves generating  threats and then demanding payments to be protected against those threats

---

States act as racketeers in three ways:

1. Generating threats through warfare 
2. Fabricating or exaggerating external threats
3. Threatening citizens directly themselves

---

"War makes states and states make war."

Charles Tilly, *Coercion, Capital and European States: 990-1992*
