## Ethnicity and Conflict

- There are basically two perspectives we want to understand
  - Fearon & Laitin (2003)
  - Cederman et. al. (2011)
- Discuss
  - Are diverse societies likely to experience conflict? 
  - What are "horizontal inequalities" and how do they matter for conflict?

## Role of Political Systems

- Electoral systems
  - Majoritarian vs. proportional
- Centralization of Authority
  - Federal vs. unitary
- Executive authority
  - Presidential vs. parliamentary 
  
--- 

## Majoritarian Systems

- ‘First past the post’ (FPTP)
  - One winner per district
  - Examples: U.S., U.K., Canada
- Duverger’s law
  - n + 1 rule
  - SMD tends toward two party competition

## First Past the Post

How might a FPTP system be problematic in a multi-ethnic society?

## Proportional Representation (PR)

- Number of seats based on % of votes won by *party*
- Voters vote for party, which fields a *list* of candidates
- Closed list PR = most common
  - Party leaders decide composition of list
  - No write-ins or reordering of candidates

--- 

## Example of PR (MMP)

How would a PR system help to promote inclusion of minority groups? Does PR have any downsides?

## Consociationalism (Lijphart)

- Emphasis: direct representation of minority interests
  - Power sharing
  - Group autonomy
- Ideal system 
  - Parliamentary with PR
  - Presidentialism not okay
  - Federalism

--- 

## Centripetalism (Horowitz)

- ‘Centripetal’--directed towards the center
  - Emphasizes national unity
  - Common ground
- Ideal system
  - Federalism = divisive
  - Presidentialism okay
  - Instant runoff voting 

--- 

## Instant Runoff Voting

- AKA "alternative vote", "ranked choice"
- Rank candidates (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
  - No clear winner, votes of losing candidate redistributed among other candidates
- Majoritarian, but minimizes ‘wasted votes’
  - 1st preferences for kin and clan
  - Subsequent preferences issue-based
- [Single Transferable Vote](https://youtu.be/l8XOZJkozfI) employs a similar runoff concept but for multi-member districts.

## Iraqi National Assembly

- AKA ‘Council of Representatives
  - Closed list PR
  - 275 seats
  - 230 allocated based on number of registered voters in Iraq’s 18 ‘governates’
  - 45 ‘compensatory’ seats
  - 25% reserved for women

- Does PR exacerbate ethnic divisions?
