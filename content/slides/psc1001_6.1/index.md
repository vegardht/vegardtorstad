	- Anglo-American countries (e.g. U.S., UK, Australia)
- Corporatist—ranked system of social insurance

## Pillars of Social Democracy

- Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRiE0ib-sjM&t=1493s)

- Three pillars of the Nordic model
	- Full Employment
	- Universal and Generous Welfare System
	- Organized Labor Market 

- Think about
	- How each pillar is important 
	- How they work together to support the system

## Retrenchment and Convergence

- Race to the bottom hypothesis
	- Globalization induces states to drastically reduce publicly provided benefits and services
- Embedded liberalism hypothesis
	- Globalization induces states to spend more on benefits and services to cushion workers from increased labor market risks
- Convergence
	- Globalization forces states to provide similar levels and types of benefits and services

## Reasons for Persistence

- Trade openness—induces countries to spend more to cushion workers (embedded liberalism)
- Partisan politics—Christian democratic and social Democratic parties favor welfare state (but different kinds)
- Electoral politics (voters like programs)
- Bureaucratic inertia (vested interests)
- Economic coordination (next section)

## Discussion

  - Iversen and Soskice

- Bernie Sanders Loves Denmark [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_U5THLkbfA&t=38s)

- Can “democratic socialism” work in the United States
	- Is it the American dream “for real”?
	- Is it possible in a U.S. context
