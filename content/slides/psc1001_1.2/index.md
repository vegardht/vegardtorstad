## Case Study

- Focuses intensely on one case
- Sometimes used  to explore potential explanations 
  - Focus on atypical cases
- Also used to explore descriptive hypotheses
  - Focus on typical cases

## Paired Comparison

- Used as basic test of causal argument

- Two cases similar in most respects except for outcome

- Typically cases within same geographic region

## Most Similar Systems

Examines cases that are similar in all or most respects to understand outcome that *differs* between them

## Most Different Systems

Examine cases that are different in all or most respects to understand a **common outcome**

## Quantitative Analysis 

Employs statistical correlations to demonstrate relationships between IVs & DVs

## Division of Labor

- Qualitative Studies
  - Good for generating hypotheses and positing mechanisms
  - Bad for testing generalizability
- Quantitative Studies
  - Good for testing generalizability
  - Bad for helping to develop hypotheses or getting at “on the ground” reality
