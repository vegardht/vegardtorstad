## Hale's Political Market Perspective 

- Candidate as consumer

- Party as supplier of goods and services that candidates use to get elected
  - Organization
  - Reputation
  - Material resources
  - Electoral know-how

--- 

Level of production depends on:

- **Supply** of the good
- **Demand** for the good
- Available ***substitutes***
  - If cost of good goes up too much, consumers turn to substitutes

## "Party Substitutes" in Russia

- Examples
  - Regional political machines
  - Politicized financial-industrial groups

- Origins
  - Soviet legacy
  - Transition policies--devolution, privatization

***Party substitutes help candidates at least as much as parties***

## Russian Party Development

- In 1990s Russian politics not party-based
  - President not partisan 
  - 80% provincial legislators nonpartisan
  - 97% governors nonpartisan
  - 50% Duma nonpartisan

- But by 2000s distinct parties had become common in Russian politics
---
## Today's Party System

- Parties have distinct political orientations and platforms
  - Pro-Putin: United Russia Party 
  - Left: Communist Party, A Just Russia
  - Conservative: Yabloko Party, Union of Right Forces
  - Nationalist: Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Rodina (formerly ‘Motherland’ Party)
- Parties behave coherently in Duma
- Voters know the parties
  - 50% express party loyalty
  - Vote along party lines
- United Russia increasingly dominant

## Nondemocratic Regimes in the Middle East

- Absolute monarchies
  - e.g. Saudi Arabia, UAE
  
- Constitutional monarchies with parliaments
  - Parliaments not mere facades
  - But flaws make them ‘partially free’ 
  - e.g. Jordan, Kuwait

---
## Why Less Democracy in the Middle East?

- Culture
  - Lack of secularism = impediment to democracy
  - All Muslim-majority countries do poorly
- Oil curse
  - Arab countries do significantly worse even among countries with large Muslim population
  - Non-Arab Muslim countries ‘over-perform’
- Which of these is right?
  - Surveys show continued support for democracy among citizens of ME countries
