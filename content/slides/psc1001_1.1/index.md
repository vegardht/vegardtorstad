## Key Questions/Topics

- “How do states become powerful?”
- “Does ethnic diversity cause violent conflict?”
- “Why are women more politically powerful in some countries than others?”
- “Does greater civic participation lead to better democracy?”
- “Why are some countries rich and others poor?”

---

## Overview

- Theoretical perspectives
- Elements of an explanation
- Correlation versus causation

---

## Theoretical Perspectives

- Rational choice
- Cultural perspectives
- Structural perspectives

---

## Variables

- **Dependent variable**--Effect or outcome that we want to explain

- **Independent variable**--The factors that explain/cause the outcome; also referred to as an "explanatory variable"

## Political Science Examples

How would you "operationalize" the study of these questions with independent and dependent variables? 

- “How do states become powerful?”
- “Does ethnic diversity cause violent conflict?”
- “Why are women more politically powerful in some countries than others?”
- “Does greater civic participation lead to better democracy?”
- “Why are some countries rich and others poor?”

## Causal Mechanisms

- Set of intervening factors or variables (or 'causal sequence') that links an independent variable to a dependent variable

- The story of the relationship between variables 

- The "because" of the relationship

## Spurious Correlation

- Does correlation = causation?

- **Spurious correlation** occurs when two variables appear to be directly linked in a cause-effect relationship but in fact (a) there is no causal link whatsoever; or (b) they are linked indirectly by some other causal variable or variables

- Occurs when we cannot specify or demonstrate the mechanism

## Political Science Examples

- Foreign aid and political stability (natural disasters)

- Civil society and democracy (wealth) 

- Electoral institutions and economic performance (colonialism)
