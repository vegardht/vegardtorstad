This project aims to provide a detailed coding of violent events associated with South Asia's many ongoing insurgencies. The primary source of data for these codings is the [South Asia Terrorism Portal](https://www.satp.org/). So far, my team has coded more than ten thousand events related to India's Maoist Insurgency occurring between 2005 and 2017. The next step will be to extend the coding of Maoist-related events to the present and then start coding events for other conflicts.
