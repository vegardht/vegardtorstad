<p>I am currently revising the <a href="https://resulumit.com/teaching/rmd_workshop.html" target="_blank"> slides</a> for the next iteration of my <a href="ttps://resulumit.com/blog/rmd-workshop.html">workshop</a> on writing reproducible research papers with R Markdown. It will take place at <a href="https://www.campus-luzern.ch/" target="_blank">Campus Luzern</a>, over two full days, in November 2020.</p>
<p>With over 200 slides in the presentation, I thought it is now time to introduce some internal links to facilitate the navigation across the different parts of the presentation, which is written with <a href="https://github.com/yihui/xaringan" target="_blank"><code>xaringan</code></a>.</p>
<p>The linking syntax in R Markdown will not work here in <code>xaringan</code> presentations as we need to identify the target slides with the <code>name</code> argument.</p>
<p>For example, assume that our presentation has a contents slide, to which we would like to link back from certain other slides, such as the final slides of each section.</p>
<p>We first name the contents slide. Note that multi-word names require hyphenation.</p>
<pre class="md"><code>---
name: contents-slide
## Contents
        
- Introduction
- Body
- Conclusion

---</code></pre>
<p>We can than link back to the target slide as we would do in R Markdown documents.</p>
<pre class="md"><code>---
# Thank you!

- Go [back to Contents](#contents-slide)

---</code></pre>
<p>This strategy can work in both directionsâ€”not only for linking backwards, but also forwards in a presentation.</p>
