This post introduces `LikeWise` --- a Shiny app that retrieves and filters users' likes on Twitter. If you are looking for a quick direction, click <a href="https://resulumit.shinyapps.io/likewise/" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a> for the app.

I use Twitter likes as bookmarks, but then struggle to find the one that I need among them all. Hence I have built an app. It is live at <a href="https://resulumit.shinyapps.io/likewise/" target="_blank">https://resulumit.shinyapps.io/likewise/</a>. It can be used here as well, in the window below.
