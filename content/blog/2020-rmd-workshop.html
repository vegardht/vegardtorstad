<p>My writing workflow has been based on R Markdown for some time. In March 2020, I organised a full-day workshop at <a href="https://www.campus-luzern.ch/" target="_blank"><b>Campus Luzern</b></a>, to share my experience with researchers from the three universities in the Swiss Canton of Lucerne. It went very well.</p>
<p>Since then I have revised the workshop material, which you can find at <a href="https://github.com/resulumit/rmd_workshop" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The slides are better viewed <a href="https://resulumit.com/teaching/rmd_workshop.html" target="_blank">here on my website</a>.*</p>
<p>I would be happy to organise this workshop again. <a href="mailto:resuluy@uio.no?subject=R Markdown workshop">Let me know</a> if this might be possible at your institution.</p>
