<p>Together with <a href="https://www.representations.online/author/lucy-kinski/" target="_blank">Lucy Kinski</a>, we are organising a new online seminar series on political representation: <a href="https://www.representations.online/" target="_blank"> 𝙍𝙚:𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀</a>!</p>
<p>The series aspires to facilitate an inclusive, supportive, and dynamic environment in which scholarly work on anything related to representation can be presented and discussed.</p>
<p>Each online seminar will consist of a 30-minute presentation, followed by meaningful opportunities for the audience to be involved in the discussion.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.representations.online/proposal/" target="_blank">propose a presentation</a> and <a href="https://www.representations.online/registration/" target="_blank">register for events</a> on the website of the series.
