## Course Description

South Asia is home to approximately one-quarter of the world’s population (about 1.8 billion people). The social, political, and economic landscape of the region is highly diverse. Many South Asians have enjoyed the freedoms associated with political democracy while others have suffered under brutal dictatorships. Some enjoy peace and stability while others experience persistent communal strife. In some places, women are treated with greater respect and dignity whereas many feature heavily patriarchal cultures and norms. Some in South Asia prosper in relatively egalitarian societies while others endure grinding poverty, inequality, and deprivation. 

This course will explore South Asia’s breathtaking political, social and economic variation through literature and film. A primary aim is to harness the insights from the realm of art to illuminate academic and policy debates. How do South Asian novels and films enhance our understanding of the legacies of colonialism, the causes of communal strife, potential solutions to endemic poverty, or the consequences of gender bias or social and economic inequality? Students will learn to develop arguments to explain variation by comparing, contrasting and synthesizing competing social scientific perspectives and to support their arguments with details from textual and visual materials. Through this exploration, students will develop a working familiarity with South Asian politics and society as well as a deeper appreciation for the unique ability of literature and film to illuminate the region’s enduring challenges.
