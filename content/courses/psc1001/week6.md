## Content

In **module 6.1** we are going to be looking at the political economy of the welfare state and, in the next module, we will talk about institutions and economic development.

In **module 6.2** we will consider the causes of economic growth and development and how a country’s regime type (whether it is authoritarian or democratic) relates to development outcomes. Here you will complete a Data Mapping exercise. The purpose of this exercise is to encourage you to think about economic trends in the BRICS nations and to illustrate these trends using the IMF Data Mapper tool.

In both modules you will be reading relevant articles and textbook chapters, as well as watch lecture and supporting videos that relay important information about the concepts listed above. You will then take a quiz to ensure you have understood what you read. These quizzes will prepare you for the final exam.
