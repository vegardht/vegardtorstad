In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors.\nElection seeking National parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. They enter into an outcome-based contract similar to voters. MEPs are either rewarded by reselection or kicked out of office. Report allocations dissipate uncertainty about MEPs’ ability. They thus improve MEPs’ career prospects to the extent that parties need new information about agent quality, and to the extent that parliamentary groups can provide it.\nOngoing work  \u0026ldquo;Blurred lines between electoral and parliamentary representation: The use of constituency staff among European Members of Parliament\u0026rdquo; with Andreja Pegan, presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2017 (Vienna)  Political actors receive public funding to execute their mandate. Spending that money for electoral purposes, however, undermines democratic representation.\nWe investigate to what extent parliamentary spending increases during campaign periods and how the electoral system affects such behavior. Specifically, we model within-individual changes in constituency-staff size among 1174 Members of the European Parliament. We find that local spending increases prior to both European and national elections and more so in candidate-centered systems.\n\r\rWe conclude that EU citizens are represented differently depending on their nationality. Insofar as constituency staff creates an incumbency advantage, the system also generates inequalities between candidates which public funding aims to equalize. Moreover, the attempt to mend Parliament’s democratic deficit by financing members’ contact with citizens also implies funding national electoral campaigns.\nA draft version can be found here.\n \u0026ldquo;How Do Legislated Gender Quotas Impact Representation?\u0026quot; Working paper presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2016 (Brussels)  How does biased political recruitment – and the subsequent legislation of quotas – affect the quality of women’s performance as representatives in Parliament? I draw on insights from the literature on political agency to distinguish between the effects of selection and sanction. First, if recruitment in the absence of quotas implies higher requirements for women, then selected women are of higher quality. Second, when quotas lower the bar, new women enter office. However, parties are less certain about the quality of these women and react by increasing accountability.\nI investigate representation in the European Parliament (1999-2014) before and after the legislation of quotas in several member states. Absent quotas, I find that biased selection leads to female representatives who pursue longer careers and perform better at equal levels of effort. When quotas are legislated, parties emphasize women’s service records during reselection. Women are thus incentivized to put in more effort.\nA draft version can be found here.\nA popularized presentation (in Norwegian) can be found here.\nPublished work   \u0026ldquo;Introducing COMEPELDA: Comprehensive European Parliament electoral data covering rules, parties and candidates\u0026rdquo; (2021) European Union Politics with Thomas Däubler and Mihail Chiru 0 (0), 1-21.\n  \u0026ldquo;Striving for influence: The effect of performance on candidate selection\u0026rdquo; (2018) Party Politics 24 (4), 382-396.\n  Legislative behavior The European Parliament (EP) is a committee-oriented legislature; meaning that the bulk of legislative work is done in committees.\nParliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift.

Policy, Performance and Impartiality\u0026rdquo; with Daniel Naurin presented at the ECPR Joint Sessions 2019 (Mons)  **\"Will do? Selecting Judges on the Basis of Policy Preferences or Performance Indicators\"** with Daniel Naurin presented at the ECPR Joint Sessions 2019 (Mons)---\rAre governments’ appointments of judges to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) politicized? And does this prevent them for emphasizing competence? The power to select judges is key to representative institutions’ control over the judiciary. Nevertheless, while the CJEU is the most powerful of international courts and motor of the judicialization of politics in Europe, the selection criteria for judicial appointments have remained a blank in the literature.\nJudges in the CJEU sit for six years renewable. All cases are decided collectively and in secrecy, so the policies judges favor are unknown. However, their influence \u0026ndash; in terms of the positions they obtain –\u0026ndash; is known. We therefore start by assuming that judges are selected for their preferences, but sanctioned for their performance.\nWe rely on original data on all potential reappointment decisions to the CJEU over a 60-year period, biographical information and key performance measures of judges’ activities at the Court.\nWe find on the one hand that governments with different economic preferences prefer different judges. That is, a change in government preferences increases the likelihood of changing the sitting judge. On the other hand, we find that governments \u0026ndash; regardless of their political preferences \u0026ndash; are more likely to retain judges who have obtained positions of influence when these positions are informative of judge\u0026rsquo;s future performance on the bench. That information is derived from the Court\u0026rsquo;s internal selection procedures when responsibilities are distributed among judges.\nA draft version can be found here.\nStrategic decision making in the CJEU  \u0026ldquo;Instrument of Power or Weapon of the Weak? Litigation and Legal Representation Before the European Court of Justice\u0026rdquo; with Louisa Boulaziz and Tommaso Pavone presented at ECPR General Conference 2021 (zoom)  The proliferation of regional organizations and international courts has expanded opportunities for nongovernmental actors to pursue transnational litigation. In the European Union (EU) legal mobilization before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has been particularly vigorous, yet a core puzzle remains unresolved: Does litigating at the ECJ empower the \u0026lsquo;have nots\u0026rsquo;, or does it reinforce the voice of the \u0026lsquo;haves\u0026rsquo;?\nWhile some studies point to the judicial expansion of EU rights protections, others stress the resource advantages of corporate litigants and their ability to mobilize specialist \u0026lsquo;Euro-lawyers.\u0026rsquo; Drawing on party capability theories and leveraging the first dataset of parties and lawyers in all national court cases referred to the ECJ, we assess whether businesses increasingly obtain better legal representation before the Court and how this advantage shapes judicial policymaking. Our longitudinal results illuminate shifting patterns of legal mobilization that partially reconcile the debate over whether litigation before the ECJ tends to advance individual rights or magnify corporate power.\n\rShiny App Iframe\r\r\r\r\r\rAnalyzing the evolution of case law requires researchers to read and compare judgments. It is a resource-intensive process both in terms of competence and number of working hours. Assessing the outcome of a case typically requires familiarity with legal precedent in the court, the doctrines under- pinning rulings as well at the type of cases brought before the tribunal. In other words, - depending on the task – the researcher needs a good grasp of similar cases in the past (i.e. legal precedent) and/or the future (i.e. its value as a precedent) as well as the field-specific vocabulary.\rThe purpose of this research note is to train a model to make such comparisons for us. To obtain word embeddings, I apply a word2vec algorithm on 30999 (machine-readable) legal texts produced by the members of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) itself. I use these to construct a do- main specific vocabulary of similar words. The similarities can then be used to identify and compare relevant documents based on their word occurrences.\rA draft version can be found [here](WordEmbeddings_Hermansen.pdf).\r--\rPublished work If who makes decisions within courts matters for the outcome of cases and their reception, then studying how cases and judges are matched is essential to understanding judicial independence.\n \u0026ldquo;Building legitimacy: strategic case allocations in the Court of Justice of the European Union\u0026rdquo; (2020) Journal of European Public Policy 27 (8), 1215-1235.

Cross-referencing data from multiple official sources, the CJEU Database Platform provides political scientists and legal scholars with an extensive collection of easily accessible, research-ready data that is compatible other data-collection projects on the CJEU. It provides a foundation for the broader CJEU Database currently being developed by a new multidisciplinary platform for research on judicial politics in the European Union (EU).

University of Oslo. Department of Political Science. 2020\nThis course provides a toolkit for students looking to execute their own research projects using quantitative methods. We explain the statistical theory behind models, but we emphasize understanding when different models are useful and how to employ them.\nThe course helps students 1) identify appropriate statistical models that describe different data types and 2) design studies that enable causal inference (as opposed to merely establishing correlation).\nDescribing data (generalized linear models) Many of the phenomena political scientists take interest in can be classified into categories or events. This includes variables like voters' choice of party, number of violent incidences in a time span, or time between violent events. The course introduces students to a number of models which are specifically designed to describe the underlying phenomenon that generates such data. The focus of the first part of the course is on correlations. Our purpose is to help students gear the statistical analysis towards a realistic description of the data.\nLecture 1: Maximum likelihood (Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 1, 2, 5-7)\nWe introduce maximum likelihood as a framework for statistical modeling.\nLecture 2: Models of outcome and choice: The logit model (Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 3)\nLogistic regression is the base-line example of a generalized linear model (GLM). We go through how to model binary outcomes, how to interpret the results from a logit and why we can\u0026rsquo;t simply run an OLS.\nLecture 3: Models of outcome and choice: Ordered and multinomial regression (Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 8-9)\nWe go through models with categorical dependent variables: Ordinal and nominal categories. Example data used in class can be downloaded here. It is the same as the data from chapter 10 in laerdegR.\nLecture 4: Event count models: Poisson regression and other alternatives (Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 10)\nEvent count models describe grouped events. They are appropriate when we do not have relevant information at the event level, but are able to both count them and design contextual predictors. We go through the poisson model and how to check for overdispersion. We then consider different strategies to adress possible overdispersion. We study the quasi-poisson and the negative binomial models as well as hurle and zero-inflated models.\nTowards the end of the lecture, we consider the decision tree for determining which GLM model might best describe our data.\nLecture 5: Event history/duration models (Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 11)\nWe can leverage information both from the fact that an event occured or not (binary outcome) and the time it took for the event to take place (count outcome). These models are made to describe a duration until an outcome occurs.\nCausal inference Beyond statistical description, researchers' interest in political phenomena is often motivated by a wish to identify their causes. Causal claims focus on whether we would continue to observe $y$ even in the absence of $x$. This is a typical question when studying the effect of policies, for example. The potential outcomes framework helps us understand the conditions under which we can identify causal relationships. The second part of the course is devoted to a set of quantitative research designs that can be used to make causal inferences.\nCausal inference (Morgan and Winship, 2015, ch 1-3; Samii 2016)\nWe go through the idea of potential outcomes. What are the comparisons we would we like to make? And what is actually possible to compare with?\nIn the R-lab we\u0026rsquo;ll look at matching techniques. We will play with a version of the data from Glyn and Sen\u0026rsquo;s daughters-effect paper in APSR from 2014.\nRegression and matching (Ho et al., 2007; Iacus, King and Porro, 2011)\nWe introduce matching as a technique to adjust for observed confounders.\nRDD and diff-in-diff (Angrist and Pischke, 2015, ch 4 and 5; Wing, Simon and Bello-Gomez, 2018; Imbens and Lemieux 2008)\nWe go through regression discontinuity designs (RDD) where a treatment kicks in at a certain cutpoint of an observed running variable. We then have a look at the differences-in-differences approach (diff-in-diff) where we observe a treatment group and a control group before and after the treatment. It\u0026rsquo;s all about interaction effects and dummies!\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll play around with data on young adults, deathrates and alcohol both from chapter 4 and chapter 5.\nInstrumental variables (Sovey and Green, 2011)\nWe introduce instrumental variables and provide guidelines for their application in political science.\nComplete syllabus \rDownload the syllabus for Statistical analysis (stv4020b)\r\r\rLearning outcome Students will get hands-on practice by learning how to implement the various techniques and by replicating existing studies in R. Students will also learn how to present results in a manner that is understandable to a general audience, for example by using graphs and other visual tools.\nMore information about the course is available at the University of Oslo\u0026rsquo;s webpages.\nDownload the syllabus\r\r ### Readings\rWe will use the following assigned readings:\r* *Ward and Ahlquist (2018)* will introduce students to maximum likelihood as a framework for statistical modelling, different generalized linear models suited for various data types frequently encountered in political science, model selection strategies, and methods for interpreting and presenting empirical results. This is the resource we will use for the first part of the course. * Chapters 1-3 in *Morgan and Winship (2015)* will introduce students to the potential outcomes framework for causal inference and causal graphs, while *Samii (2016)* reviews the turn towards “causal empiricism” in political science that builds on these ideas.\r* *Ho et al. (2007)* and *Iacus, King and Porro (2011)* introduce matching as a technique to adjust for observed confounders. * Chapter 4 in *Angrist and Pischke (2014)* will introduce students to regression discontinuity designs, while *Imbens and Lemieux (2008)* provide more detailed advice for the use of this design in applied research. * Chapter 5 in *Angrist and Pischke (2014)* will introduce students to difference-in-differences designs, while *Wing, Simon and Bello-Gomez (2018)* provide more detailed advice for the use of this design in applied research. * *Sovey and Green (2011)* introduce instrumental variables and provide guidelines for their application in political science. Some students may find some of the readings (such as Ward and Ahlquist (2018)) to be technically demanding. If so: Do not despair! We will use the lectures to clarify and provide intuition.

Although few theoretical developments have focused on the eﬀects of expertise on delegation, empirical studies have commonly assumed monotonic eﬀects. Based on the theoretical model by Fischer and Stocken (2001), we argue that more expertise, holding preference divergence constant, has a non-monotonic eﬀect on the probability of being appointed as a rapporteur because of informational credibility. Employing accumulated committee service as an expertise measure, we test this theoretical expectation on all committee report delegations in the European Parliament from 1979 - 2014. Across both nonparametric and parametric hierarchical conditional logit models we ﬁnd support for this non-monotonic eﬀect. The results hold across member states, political groups, procedures, committees, and over time.\nOutreach\nA popularized version of the paper is featured on LSE\u0026rsquo;s EUROPP-blog: \u0026ldquo;A question of trust: Intra-party delegation in the European Parliament\u0026rdquo;.\nReference\n Chiou, Fang-Yi, Hermansen, Silje Synnøve Lyder and Bjørn Høyland (2020) \u0026ldquo;Delegation of Committee Reports in the European Parliament\u0026rdquo; European Union Politics, 21(2), 233-254.

I argue that the President builds the Court’s legitimacy by strategically allocating cases to select judges.\nUsing original data on 9623 case allocations (1980-2015), I argue that suspicions about judges’ political accountability can polarize already politicized debates. The President circumvents such dynamicsby appointing a rapporteur whose government holds moderate political preferences. However, he considers governmental preferencesand disagreements mainly when case law is not yet developed. This may also contribute to explaining judges individual-level specialization, which arguably favors the construction of a coherent case law.\nThe results speak to the lingering effect of judges’ renewable terms \u0026ndash; despite secret voting \u0026ndash; as well as the importance of courts internalorganization for judicial independence.\nReference\n Hermansen, Silje Synnøve Lyder (2020) \u0026ldquo;Building legitimacy: strategic case allocations in the Court of Justice of the European Union\u0026rdquo; Journal of European Public Policy, 27(8), pp 1215-1235  ","date":1579737600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579737600,"objectID":"ba76562225f1754cf6c404a5d4f4b2f7","permalink":"https://siljehermansen.github.io/publication/jepp2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jepp2020/","section":"publication","summary":"(2020) Journal of European Public Policy, 27(8), pp 1215-1235 Best papers from the European Union Studies Association 2019 Biennial Conference in Denver, USA.\n","tags":["Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)","Rapporteurs","Judicial behavior","Political accountability","Selection","Policy specialization"],"title":"Building legitimacy: strategic case allocations in the Court of Justice of the European Union","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silje Synnøve Lyder Hermansen"],"categories":null,"content":"Master\u0026rsquo;s/PhD level.

We go through the statistical theory behind models, but we emphasize understanding when models are useful and how to employ them. The course helps students 1) identify appropriate statistical models that describe different data types and 2) design studies that enable causal inference (as opposed to merely establishing correlation).\nMany of the phenomena political scientists take interest in can be classified into categories or events. This includes variables like voters' choice of party, number of violent incidences in a time span or time between violent events. The course introduces students to a number of models which are specifically designed to describe the underlying phenomenon that generates such data. The focus of the first part of the course is on correlations. Our purpose is to help students gear the statistical analysis towards a realistic description of the data.\nBeyond statistical description, researchers' interest in political phenomena is often motivated by a wish to identify their causes. Causal claims focus on whether we would continue to observe $y$ even in the absence of $x$. This is a typical question when studying the effect of policies, for example. The potential outcomes framework provides a useful heuristic for assessing causal relationships. The second part of the course is devoted to a set of quantitative research designs that can be used to make causal inferences.\nLearning outcome Students will get hands-on practice by learning how to implement the various techniques and by replicating existing studies in R. Students will also learn how to present results in a manner that is understandable to a general audience, for example by using graphs and other visual tools.\nMore information about the course is available at the University of Oslo\u0026rsquo;s webpages.\n\rDownload the syllabus\r\r Slides   Maximum likelihood\n  Logistic regression (Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 3)\n  Logistic regression is the base-line example of a generalized linear model (GLM). We go through how to model binary outcomes, how to interpret the results from a logit and why we can\u0026rsquo;t simply run an OLS.\n Ordered and multinomial regression (Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 8-9)  We go through models with categorical dependent variables: Ordinal and nominal categories. Example data used in class can be downloaded here. It is the same as the data from chapter 10 in laerdegR.\n Event count models (Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 10)  Event count models describe grouped events. They are appropriate when we do not have relevant information at the event level, but are able to both count them and design contextual predictors. We go through the poisson model and how to check for overdispersion. We then consider different strategies to adress possible overdispersion. We study the quasi-poisson and the negative binomial models as well as hurle and zero-inflated models.\n Event history/duration models (Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 11)  We can leverage information both from the fact that an event occured or not (binary outcome) and the time it took for the event to take place (count outcome). These models are made to describe a duration until an outcome occurs.\n Causal inference (Angrist and Pischke, 2015, ch 1)  We go through the idea of potential outcomes. What are the comparisons we would we like to make? And what is actually possible to compare with?\nIn the R-lab we\u0026rsquo;ll look at matching techniques. We will play with a version of the data from Glyn and Sen\u0026rsquo;s daughters-effect paper in APSR from 2014.\n  Regression and matching (Angrist and Pischke, 2015, ch 2)\n  RDD and diff-in-diff (Angrist and Pischke, 2015, ch 4 and 5)\n  We go through regression discontinuity designs (RDD) where a treatment kicks in at a certain cutpoint of an observed running variable. We then have a look at the differences-in-differences approach (diff-in-diff) where we observe a treatment group and a control group before and after the treatment. It\u0026rsquo;s all about interaction effects and dummies!\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll examplify with data from chapter 4 and chapter 5 in the book.\n  Instrumental variables (Angrist and Pischke, 2015, ch 3 and 6)\n  LaTeX + R = Sant\n  A brief introduction to LaTeX and how to use it in combination with R scripts (in Norwegian).\n]`.\r---  ","date":1573776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573776000,"objectID":"fddd5c63b7b321d9165c10d0d4881e4e","permalink":"https://siljehermansen.github.io/teaching/stv4020b_2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/stv4020b_2019/","section":"teaching","summary":"Master's/PhD level.

By applying an adverse selection model, I argue that the selectorate looks to past performance to select candidates it expects will gain influence. However, the impact of performance varies according to the need for and availability of information.\nThe European Parliament (EP) provides a most-likely case for information asymmetry. Studying three elections in 11 member states, I find that the allocation of influential positions in office improves chances of reselection. The effect increases when the allocation is more selective, and when the prior uncertainty around candidacies is high. The study thus proposes a new approach to the relationship between national parties and transnational groups in the EP. It also suggests venues for research on parliamentary politics and candidate selection in general.

They are appointed by their political groups. In making these appointments, these groups need to accommodate both their collective needs and individual requests.\nThis article explores situations in which the collective need for information is prioritised: the codecision procedure. The data includes allocations over a 10-year period (2004–2014) in three of the most powerful EP committees, as well as key career choices among members.\nEP groups emphasise policy-specific expertise. They also pay attention to individual members’ requests for exposure, but only when the expected policy drift is minimal. Harsh selection during the allocation of codecision reports creates pressure to accommodate a greater selection of legislators during other attractive report allocations. Own-initiative reports therefore affect allocation of codecision reports negatively.\nOnline supplementary files can be downloaded here\nReference\n Hermansen, Silje Synnøve Lyder (2018) \u0026ldquo;(Self-)selection and expertise among decision-makers in the European Parliament\u0026rdquo;, The Journal of Legislative Studies, 24 (1), pp 148-172.

National parties organize elections. Parliamentary work is organized around transnational political groups. They do not share any overarching organizational structure. My contributions pertain to the interconnected choices made by MEPs and their two party organizations.\nParliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift. Groups allocate reports to maximize the value added by the rapporteur while limiting the drift. They prefer policy experts to generalists and -- up to a point -- experienced MEPs to newcomers. Groups also balance individual demands with the collective need.\nNational parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. They enter into an outcome-based contract similar to voters. MEPs are either rewarded by reselection or kicked out of office. Report alloca-tions dissipate uncertainty about MEPs’ ability.
