&lt;p&gt;Political parties obtain influence through their choice of representatives. &lt;em&gt;Outside&lt;/em&gt; of parliament, they gain sway through the candidates for whom they secure election. &lt;em&gt;Inside&lt;/em&gt; parliament party groups shape policies through the allocation of tasks to competent members. This project delves into the mutual influence of parliamentary group allocations and the choices made by extra-parliamentary party organizations. In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors. In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;election-seeking&#34;&gt;Election seeking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. They enter
into an outcome-based contract similar to voters. MEPs are either rewarded by reselection or kicked out of office. Report allocations dissipate uncertainty about MEPs’ ability. They thus improve MEPs’ career prospects to the extent that parties need new information about agent quality, and to the extent that parliamentary groups can provide it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blurred lines between electoral and parliamentary representation:  The use of constituency staff among European Members of Parliament&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pegan.org/&#34;&gt;Andreja Pegan&lt;/a&gt;, presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2017 (Vienna)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political actors receive public funding to execute their mandate. Spending that money for electoral purposes, however, undermines democratic representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigate to what extent parliamentary spending increases during campaign periods and how the electoral system affects such behavior. Specifically, we model within-individual changes in constituency-staff size among 1174 Members of the European Parliament. We find that local spending increases prior to both European and national elections and more so in candidate-centered systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that EU citizens are represented differently depending on their nationality. Insofar as constituency staff creates an incumbency advantage, the system also generates inequalities between candidates which public funding aims to equalize. Moreover, the attempt to mend Parliament’s democratic deficit by financing members’ contact with citizens also implies funding national electoral campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Do Legislated Gender Quotas Impact Representation?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Working paper presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2016 (Brussels)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does biased political recruitment – and the subsequent legislation of quotas – affect the quality of women’s performance as representatives in Parliament? I draw on insights from the literature on political agency to distinguish between the effects of selection and sanction.  First, if recruitment in the absence of quotas implies higher requirements for women, then selected women are of higher quality. Second, when quotas lower the bar, new women enter office.  However, parties are less certain about the quality of these women and react by increasing accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I investigate representation in the European Parliament (1999-2014) before and after the legislation of quotas in several member states.  Absent quotas, I find that biased selection leads to female representatives who pursue longer careers and perform better at equal levels of effort. When quotas are legislated, parties emphasize women’s service records during reselection.  Women are thus incentivized to put in more effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament (EP) is a committee-oriented legislature; meaning that the bulk of legislative work is done in committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift. We argue that groups allocate reports to maximize the value added by the rapporteur while limiting the drift. They prefer loyal policy experts to generalists and &amp;ndash; up to a point &amp;ndash; experienced MEPs to newcomers. Groups also balance individual demands with the collective need.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decision makers in the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)</title>
      <link>https://siljehermansen.github.io/project/court-of-justice-of-the-european-union/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://siljehermansen.github.io/project/court-of-justice-of-the-european-union/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is probably the world’s most influential international court, functioning in many respects as a federal supreme court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, little research exists on how judges enter the Court and how its internal organization affects decision making.  This project opens the black box of these decision-making processes to consider governments’ and judges’ strategic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I show that judges&#39; performance and governments&#39; political preferences are intertwined both when judges are appointed and when influence is distributed within the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;judicial-appointments-to-the-cjeu&#34;&gt;Judicial appointments to the CJEU&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Holding Judges To Account. Policy, Performance and Impartiality&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;  with Daniel Naurin presented at the ECPR Joint Sessions 2019 (Mons)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!---* &lt;a href=&#34;WillDo_HermansenNaurin.pdf&#34; style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;**&#34;Will do? Selecting Judges on the Basis of Policy Preferences or Performance Indicators&#34;**&lt;/a&gt;  with Daniel Naurin presented at the ECPR Joint Sessions 2019 (Mons)---&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are governments’ appointments of judges to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) politicized? And does this prevent them for emphasizing competence? The power to select judges is key to representative institutions’ control over the judiciary. Nevertheless, while the CJEU is the most powerful of international courts and motor of the judicialization of politics in Europe, the selection criteria for judicial appointments have remained a blank in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges in the CJEU sit for six years renewable. All cases are decided collectively and in secrecy, so the policies judges favor are unknown. However, their influence &amp;ndash; in terms of the positions they obtain –&amp;ndash; is known. We therefore start by assuming that judges are selected for their preferences, but sanctioned for their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;Effectplot_preferences_economy_CJ.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; alt=&#34;Graphic showing that the likelihood of replacing a sitting judge increases with the distance between the economic preferences of the appointing and reappointing government.&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rely on original data on all potential reappointment decisions to the CJEU over a 60-year period, biographical information and key performance measures of judges’ activities at the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find on the one hand that governments with different economic preferences prefer different judges. That is, a change in government preferences increases the likelihood of changing the sitting judge. On the other hand, we find that governments &amp;ndash; regardless of their political preferences &amp;ndash; are more likely to retain judges who have obtained positions of influence when these positions are informative of judge&amp;rsquo;s future performance on the bench. That information is derived from the Court&amp;rsquo;s internal selection procedures when responsibilities are distributed among judges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Instrument of Power or Weapon of the Weak? Litigation and Legal Representation Before the European Court of Justice&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; with Louisa Boulaziz and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tommasopavone.com/&#34;&gt;Tommaso Pavone&lt;/a&gt; presented at ECPR General Conference 2021 (zoom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of regional organizations and international courts has expanded opportunities for nongovernmental actors to pursue transnational litigation. In the European Union (EU) legal mobilization before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has been particularly vigorous, yet a core puzzle remains unresolved: Does litigating at the ECJ empower the &amp;lsquo;have nots&amp;rsquo;, or does it reinforce the voice of the &amp;lsquo;haves&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some studies point to the judicial expansion of EU rights protections, others stress the resource advantages of corporate litigants and their ability to mobilize specialist &amp;lsquo;Euro-lawyers.&amp;rsquo; Drawing on party capability theories and leveraging the first dataset of parties and lawyers in all national court cases referred to the ECJ, we assess whether businesses increasingly obtain better legal representation before the Court and how this advantage shapes judicial policymaking. Our longitudinal results illuminate shifting patterns of legal mobilization that partially reconcile the debate over whether litigation before the ECJ tends to advance individual rights or magnify corporate power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--* **&#34;Measuring the evolution of CJEU case law using word embeddings&#34;** presented at Big Insight - a center for research-based innovation, Norwegian Computing Center 2019 (Oslo)

To study the conditions for judicial activism – self-restraint, initiation or expansion of case law – we need a consistent and comparable measure of court output. Can machine learning help us in this respect? This research note discusses ways of comparing court documents in order to obtain such measures. The focus is on word embeddings, which allow researchers to identify similar – but not identical – terms and use them as building blocks for document-level comparisons.

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;Effect_of_judgment_similarity_on_academic_attention.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; alt=&#34;Effect of judgment similarity on academic attention (annotations in legal journals).&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

Analyzing the evolution of case law requires researchers to read and compare judgments. It is a resource-intensive process both in terms of competence and number of working hours. Assessing the outcome of a case typically requires familiarity with legal precedent in the court, the doctrines under- pinning rulings as well at the type of cases brought before the tribunal. In other words, - depending on the task – the researcher needs a good grasp of similar cases in the past (i.e. legal precedent) and/or the future (i.e. its value as a precedent) as well as the field-specific vocabulary.

The purpose of this research note is to train a model to make such comparisons for us. To obtain word embeddings, I apply a word2vec algorithm on 30999 (machine-readable) legal texts produced by the members of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) itself. I use these to construct a do- main specific vocabulary of similar words. The similarities can then be used to identify and compare relevant documents based on their word occurrences.

&lt;p&gt;If who makes decisions within courts matters for the outcome of cases and their reception, then studying how cases and judges are matched is essential to understanding judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The CJEU Database Platform: Decisions and Decision-Makers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; with Stein Arne Brekke, Joshua Fjelstul and Daniel Naurin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article presents &lt;em&gt;The CJEU Database Platform: Decisions and Decision-Makers&lt;/em&gt;, which includes data on the universe of cases, decisions, and judges at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Cross-referencing data from multiple official sources, the CJEU Database Platform provides political scientists and legal scholars with an extensive collection of easily accessible, research-ready data that is compatible other data-collection projects on the CJEU. It provides a foundation for the broader CJEU Database currently being developed by a new multidisciplinary platform for research on judicial politics in the European Union (EU). In this article, we illustrate how researchers can use data from the CJEU Database Platform to study the internal politics of the Court, opening the door to new areas of theoretical and empirical research on judicial politics in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
